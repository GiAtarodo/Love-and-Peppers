<h1>LOVE AND PEPPER</h1>

<p>I am a natural lover of pepper and that automatically makes me a lover of love. Many people may ask me how do these two things relate and as we dive right into the depths, you'll realise that these two are not far from each other as one would assume. It hurts me how I've failed to keep love down in the same way I have struggled with my peppers.<br> It's the heart burn, the chest pains, indigestion, rumbling tummy, sleepless nights and heart palpartaions that make it difficult for me to stay and remain a faithful lover of pepper and love.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:25px;">ATARODO</h2>
<p style="font-size:15px;">In the streets, they call me ATARODO, the original, flaming scotch bonnet. I'm too hot to handle. Like the scotch bonnet, many people do not take precaution when handing me.<br>One, they don't wear gloves. They carelessly proceed to chop the pepper with bare hands, don't wash them but want to shine their eyes with pepper juice smothered hands. What careless behaviour. One importamt aspect about me that they negelect is that like the atarodo, I am detrimental to their sensitivity</p>

<h3 style="font-size:25px;">TATASHE</h3>
<p style="font-size:15px;">As lovely and fiery it is to be the heat of the town, sometimes I wish I was as sweet and timid as the humble tatashe. The beautiful, sweet red bell pepper. No meal is every complete without it. It is a favourite in households.<br>Loved by children and adored by mothers because of the warm, red colour it brings to their stews, tatashe is loved, appriciated and most importantly seen. I mean it is regarded as a national treasure.<br>At times, I wish I was seen like tatashe. Appreciated and valued. What makes the bell pepper famous is of its nurturing role similar to that of a mother. A mother who cares, nurtures her household, warms it up but mosst importantly, ties all the different aspects and people of her house together to create a home. Tatashe is definately not a loud mouth like Atarodp. Maybe I would need to increase my timidness in order to fit into many meals. It's clear no one appreciates a sharp mouth and an even more firery kick to the soul.</p>
